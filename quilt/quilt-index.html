            "I embarked on my quilting journey around 1993, inspired by my twin aunts who had been freehand quilting for the past 30 years.
            Their beautiful quilts captivated me, and I was eager to learn. Despite my persistent requests for lessons, their advice was
            always the same: "Just take a class."<br><br>

            My first project was a housedress pattern quilt. I was drawn to the idea of creating various housedress designs within a single
            quilt. However, I quickly realized that my beginner skills were not quite up to the challenge. Nevertheless, I persevered and,
            after a year of dedication, completed the quilt. I entered it in the Salt Lake County Fair and was thrilled to win 2nd place in
            the amateur division. This achievement encouraged me to continue, and I have since entered numerous quilts and table runners in
            the Fair.<br><br>

            Although my daughters have used that first quilt as a bedspread, and it now looks well-loved, it remains dear to my heart. I
            wouldn‚Äôt recommend a housedress pattern to a beginner quilter. Last year, I revisited the pattern, creating a peach-colored
            6-dress quilt for the challenge competition at the fair using their provided fabric.<br><br>

            Around the same time, I made a small table square that I keep to remind me of my growth as a quilter and piecer. In quilting,
            these are two distinct roles: piecing involves assembling the quilt top, while quilting means stitching the quilt sandwich (top,
            batting, and backing) together. My motto is that a perfect quilt is a finished quilt. I firmly believe that a quilt isn‚Äôt truly
            complete unless it‚Äôs quilted, whether by hand or machine, depending on personal preference.<br><br>

            My first official quilt class in 2008 resulted in a green and pink quilt with nine large squares in the center and approximately
            32 smaller patches around it. My favorite square from this class was the drunkard's path.<br><br>

            Another cherished project is a tan and green quilt with an old automobile pattern that my mother made for my son, Christian.
            Over time, the quilt became frayed and worn, and the backing was beyond repair. Christian brought it to me, hoping I could work
            some "mom magic" to fix it. This quilt was tied, like all my mom's quilts, before the advent of long-arm quilting. I managed to
            cut off the damaged edges, removed the yarn knots, and replaced the backing with new fabric. I quilted it using a fan pattern,
            and when I returned it to him, he was overjoyed to have his beloved quilt restored.<br><br>

            I have a variety of quilts for different holidays, with Halloween and Christmas being my favorites. I enjoy rotating my wall
            hangings each month to celebrate the changing seasons and festivities. I have also made quilts for nearly all my family and
            extended family members as well as for friends or neighbors who have lost loved ones, or are expecting a baby. I find joy in the
            knowledge that my quilts provide warmth and love to those who receive them."<br><br>
