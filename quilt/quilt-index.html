        <p class="story-paragraph">
            I began my quilting journey in 1993, inspired by my twin aunts who had been freehand quilting for 30 years. Their beautiful
            quilts captivated me, and I was eager to learn. Despite my persistent requests for lessons, their advice was always the same:
            "Just take a class."
            <br><br>
            My first project was a housedress pattern quilt. Although challenging for a beginner, I persevered and completed it after a
            year. I entered it in the Salt Lake County Fair and won 2nd place in the amateur division. This achievement encouraged me to
            continue quilting.
            <br><br>
            Over the years, I have created numerous quilts and table runners, many of which have been entered in the Fair. I have also made
            quilts for family, friends, and neighbors, providing warmth and love to those who receive them.
            <br><br>
            Quilting has become a cherished part of my life, and I enjoy creating quilts for different holidays and occasions. My motto is
            that a perfect quilt is a finished quilt, whether quilted by hand or machine.
