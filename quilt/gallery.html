        <p>Traditionally, multi-layered textiles were composed of three layers of fiber: a woven cloth top, a layer of batting or wadding,
            and a woven back combined using the technique of quilting, the process of sewing the three layers together.</p>

                <p>
                    Green is a color that is associated with freshness, energy, and growth. It is a color that is often used in
                    quilting to add a pop of color and interest to a quilt.

                <p>
                    This quilt is made up of charm squares and jelly rolls. Charm squares are 5-inch squares of fabric, and jelly rolls are

                <p>
                    Quilted Cherries are one of my favorites. They remind me of large family gatherings around picknick tables, picking
                    cherries in my grandparents orchard. the sweetness of life and the importance of cherishing the moments we have..

                <p>
                    An heirloom quilt has been passed down through generations of a family. It is a quilt that has been made with love and
                    care, and will be treasured by the family for many years.
