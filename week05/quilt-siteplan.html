        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>The purpose of the Quilt Creations website is to provide a platform for the owner to showcase her quilting projects, sell quilts,
            and offer quilting services. The site will also provide information about the owner and her quilting experience.</p>

        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>The primary audience for the Quilt Creations website is for individuals who are interested in having their projects bound and
            quilted by a professional longarm quilter. The secondary audience is for individuals who are interested in purchasing a quilt,
            or are looking for inspiration for their own quilting projects.</p>

        <h3>Dynamic Elements</h3>
        <p>The Quilt Creations website will include the following dynamic elements:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Home page will be a right aligned scrolling wheel of quilts that open in a dialog box when clicked. The nav links and
                description will be left aligned and simultaniously scrolling with the right aligned images.</li>
            <li>The Services page will be a combined gallery/services page, showcasing examples of her services with a variety of quilts
                that the owner has created. Each quilt will have a title, description and image. Clicking on a quilt image will open a
                larger dialog box explaining the technique used and pricing.</li>
            <li>The Contact Me page and form will include a form that users can fill out to contact the owner, a map of the owner's
                location, and the owner's contact information.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Integration of Requirements</h3>
        <p>
            - Functionss and ES Modules: Three functions to fetch quilts and patterns, handle form submission and toggle modals that will be
            organized into seperate ES modules for clarity and reusability.<br>
            - DOM Interaction: Select elements, modify them, and add event listeners (e.g., selecting quilt images, adding event listeners
            for click events to open the modal).<br>.
            - Conditional Branching: Use conditions to handle different scenarios (e.g., checking if a form field is empty before
            processing).<br>
            - The site will be optimized for search engines to increase visibility.<br>
            - Template Literals: Use template literals to build strings (e.g., creating HTML content for quilt services).<br>
            - Local Storage: Store form data in localStorage when the form is submitted as well as emailing the owner upon submission.<br>
            - Fetch JSON Data: Fetch quilts and patterns from a local JSON file or a remote API using an asynchronous function.<br>
            - Asynchronous Function with Try Block: Use fetchQuiltPatterns() function to fetch data asynchronously with a try block for
            error handling.<br>
            - Build at Least 15 Items Dynamically: Store 15 images or patterns and display them dynamically on the page.<br>
            - Use of Modal Dialog: Implement the toggleModal() and closeModal() functions to handle displaying the information about the
            quilt techniques and patterns.<br>
