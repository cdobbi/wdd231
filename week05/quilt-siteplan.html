        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Site Name & Purpose:</h3>
        <p>
            The name 'Quilt Creations' reflects the very purpose of the site, which is to provide a platform for the owner to showcase her
            quilting projects, sell quilts, and offer quilting services.
        </p>

        <h3>Audience Scenarios:</h3>
        <p>
            - The primary individual is interested in having their projects bound and quilted by a professional longarm quilter. A question
            one might ask would be, "What patterns do you offer and do you have completed examples of these?"<br>
            - The secondary individual who is looking to purchasing a quilt or quilt pattern. A question one might ask would be, "I am
            looking for a unique and beautiful quilt to purchase, what quilts do you have available for sale? If I decide to make a quilt
            myself, what quilt patterns do you have available?"<br>
            - The tertiary individual is looking for tutorials or inspiration. A question they might ask is, "Where can I find tutorials or
            peruse pictures of the possibilities?"
        </p>

        <h3>Dynamic Elements</h3>
        <p>
            The Quilt Creations website will include the following dynamic elements:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Home page will be a right aligned scrolling wheel of quilts. Nav links and description will be left aligned and
                simultaniously scrolling with the right aligned images.
            </li>
            <li>
                Services page will be a combined gallery/services page, showcasing examples of services with a variety of quilts the owner
                created. Each quilt will have a title, description and image. Clicking a quilt image opens a dialog box explaining the
                technique used and pricing.
            </li>
            <li>
                Contact Me page and form includes a form users fill out to contact the owner, a map of the owner's location with link, and
                the owner's contact information with linking email..
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Integration of Requirements</h3>
        <p>
            - Functionss and ES Modules: Three functions to fetch quilts and patterns, handle form submission and toggle modals that will be
            organized into seperate ES modules for clarity and reusability.<br>
            - DOM Interaction: Select elements, modify them, and add event listeners (e.g., selecting quilt images, adding event listeners
            for click events to open the modal).<br>.
            - Conditional Branching: Use conditions to handle different scenarios (e.g., checking if a form field is empty before
            processing).<br>
            - The site will be optimized for search engines to increase visibility.<br>
            - Template Literals: Use template literals to build strings (e.g., creating HTML content for quilt services).<br>
            - Local Storage: Store form data in localStorage when the form is submitted as well as emailing the owner upon submission.<br>
            - Fetch JSON Data: Fetch quilts and patterns from a local JSON file or a remote API using an asynchronous function.<br>
            - Asynchronous Function with Try Block: Use fetchQuiltPatterns() function to fetch data asynchronously with a try block for
            error handling.<br>
            - Build at Least 15 Items Dynamically: Store 15 images or patterns and display them dynamically on the page.<br>
            - Use of Modal Dialog: Implement the toggleModal() and closeModal() functions to handle displaying the information about the
            quilt techniques and pricing.<br>
